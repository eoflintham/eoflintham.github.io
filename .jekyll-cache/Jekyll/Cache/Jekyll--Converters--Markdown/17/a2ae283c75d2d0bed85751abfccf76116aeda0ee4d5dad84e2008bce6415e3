He is currently a PhD student at Imperial supervised by Vincent Savolainen, Matteo Fumagalli and Charles Mullon. He uses mathematical models to study the evolutionary genetics of sex-specific selection and sexual conflict. In particular, he is interested in the role of population ecology in influencing the evolution of sex differences, and the repercussions of this for patterns of genetic variation in natural populations.</p>
